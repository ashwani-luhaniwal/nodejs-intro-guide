/**
 * ------------------
 * NodeJS - Debugger
 * ------------------
 * Node.js provides a simple TCP based protocol and built-in debugging client. For debugging your 
 * JavaScript file, you can use debug argument followed by the js file name you want to debug.
 * 
 *      node debug [script.js | -e "script" | <host>:<port>]
 * 
 * If you make any error in your js file source code or provide a wrong path on the Node.js command 
 * prompt then you will get the error.
